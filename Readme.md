Problem Statement 2: Booking Without App

The ability to book a Namma Yatri auto could open  up more demand. Build innovative tech solutions to  let customers book an auto without installing the  app - E.g. website, WhatsApp, SMS, Phone etc. This  will cater to users who are uncomfortable or  unwilling to use Apps.<br>

This can acheived by using WhatsAppâ€™s official  Business API (Cloud API) from Meta. <br>
Using this API  we can easily send and receive any kinds of  message from the user enabling the customer to  book ride with their comfort.
